## üö® **KNOWN LIMITATIONS**

1. **Image Format Support**: Currently only PNG output (JPEG/WEBP not implemented)
2. **Grid Templates**: No predefined templates or presets available
3. **Grid Duplication**: Copy/paste functionality not implemented
4. **Batch UI**: No progress bar for large operations
5. **Export Options**: Limited export customization options

## üìä **TESTING SCENARIOS**

### Basic Workflow
1. Create new project ‚Üí Import image ‚Üí Select grid tool ‚Üí Create grid ‚Üí Slice grid
2. Verify all grid cells are extracted with correct naming
3. Check output folder organization and file structure

### Edge Cases
1. Grid larger than image boundaries
2. Grid with 1√ó1 dimensions
3. Multiple overlapping grids on same image
4. Very small grid cells (< 10px)
5. Grid with zero logical thickness

### Performance Tests
1. Large number of grids (10+) on single image
2. High-resolution images (4K+) with fine grids
3. Batch processing multiple large images
4. Memory usage during intensive slicing operations

## üîß **IMPLEMENTATION STATUS**
