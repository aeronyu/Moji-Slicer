**Task:**  
Complete export pipeline integration and final UI polish for Moji Slicer.

**Current State:**

- ✅ `ModernGridOverlayView` with resize handles and drag support (COMPLETE)
- ✅ `@Observable GridProperties` with `@Bindable` binding (COMPLETE)
- ✅ Grid creation in `MainCanvasView` with tool selection (COMPLETE)
- ✅ Visual feedback (hover, selection, animations) (COMPLETE)

**Requirements:**

- Complete `SlicingEngine` integration with grid overlays (mostly done, needs testing)
- Implement batch export operations and file organization
- Add image selection and manipulation controls
- Polish UI for production readiness
- Add error handling and validation improvements

**Architecture:**

- Follow existing Models/Core/ vs Models/UI/ separation pattern
- Use existing computed properties and @Observable patterns
- Leverage established SwiftUI component hierarchy

**Constraints:**

- Maintain existing project-centric workflow around Project entities
- Preserve existing canvas pan/zoom and grid functionality
- Follow established component hierarchy (Screens/Components/Sheets)

**Success:**  
Export pipeline works end-to-end, UI is production-ready, no regressions in existing grid system.

**Documentation Updates Required:**

- Update `README.md` "Known Issues Being Addressed" section
- Update `planning/STATUS_TRACKING.md`
- Update relevant `planning/[feature].md` files
